abstract="Hereby we present the construction and usage of ``Weak Connectiou''(WeCo) on Neural Networks(NN). We will show how these parallelization hypothesis increases the final system flexibility. The net design is based on standard procedures, but changed accordingly to WeCo parallelization principles. WeCo means parallelization with less weight on communication systems, as in: fine, medium and coarse grain parallelism, or between the parts of the implementation program. WeCo lays in-between parallel computers and sequential machines, building the bridge between them.",

Thiswork builds on recent ideas of Volker Strassen, by using a basic trilinear form which is not a matrix product. We make novel use of the Salem-Spencer Theorem, which gives a fairly dense set of integers with no three-term arithmetic progression. Our resulting matrix exponent is 2.376."

abstract = {With the increase in available data parallel machine learning has become an increasingly pressing problem. In this paper we present the first parallel stochastic gradient descent algorithm including a detailed analysis and experimental evidence. Unlike prior work on parallel optimization algorithms [5, 7] our variant comes with parallel acceleration guarantees and it poses no overly tight latency constraints, which might only be available in the multicore setting. Our analysis introduces a novel proof technique — contractive mappings to quantify the speed of convergence of parameter distributions to their asymptotic limits. As a side effect this answers the question of how quickly stochastic gradient descent algorithms reach the asymptotically normal regime [1, 8].},
