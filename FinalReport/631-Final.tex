%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
With the major advances and gain in popularity of machine learning it has become
increasingly important to optimize and parallelize these types of code. Much of
the mathematics behind machine learning is based on tensor operations,
specifically tensor multiplication. This creates a ripe environment for the
study of parallelization techniques. Within this project we study the effects of
OpenMP and CUDA acceleration within an Artificial Neural Network. We draw on
design inspiration from popular machine learning frameworks such as PyTorch
and TensorFlow to better understand how they work under the abstraction layers
that they provide. Through our implementations we found an overall speed-up of
$4.5$x through the use of OpenMP but were unable to find speedup due to CUDA
implementation. Within this paper we discuss our successes and failures in
the implementations of accelerating technologies.

%   FAQ\medskip\\
%   {\bf Q:} Are acknowledgements OK?\\
%   {\bf A:} No.  Leave them for the final copy.\medskip\\
%   {\bf Q:} How do I cite my results reported in open challenges?
%   {\bf A:} To conform with the double blind review policy, you can report results of other challenge participants together with your results in your paper. For your results, however, you should not identify yourself and should not mention your participation in the challenge. Instead present your results referring to the method proposed in your paper and draw conclusions based on the experimental comparison to other results.\medskip\\
